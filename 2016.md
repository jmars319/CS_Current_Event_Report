The 2016 presidential election was marked by a large amount of interference. Both the DNC and RNC were found to have been compromised, yet the information from the DNC machines remains as the majority of leaks to various websites and news outlets. The attack on the DNC was orchestrated at least in part via a spear-phishing operation, meaning highly targeted emails containing illegitimate links disguised as legitimate documents. These links directed to the hacker’s website, where they could easily obtain the needed credentials.

In addition, a staffer’s typo reinforced the idea of the emails being legitimate. This led to hackers obtaining enough stolen credentials to access more than 30 computers across the DNC network. With this information, the hackers stole thousands of emails from the DNC server before concealing their breach. They later anonymously began to leak these emails on the Internet, including supplying them to WikiLeaks. The hackers eventually published cell phone numbers and personal email addresses of members of the DNC.

The vulnerability was first discovered by the FBI, who contacted the DNC help desk. The FBI informed them more than once that at least one of their computers had been transmitting information to Russia. The DNC’s IT department failed to pass along this message to their leadership long enough for the hackers to gain access to their email server. The DNC hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate the intrusion, but it was too late to avoid the theft of tens of thousands of emails.

It appears that very little could have been done to prevent this intrusion. As a combination of very targeted phishing attempts disguising malicious links as important analytics documents and simple human error, it would be very difficult to account for all the factors that led the DNC to the situation it found itself in.
